RESULTS OF ANALYSIS

This analysis aimed to determine whether the VA clinics in Northeast Ohio
are equally accessible to veterans across age cohorts. The data indicate that,
largely, they are. Across age cohorts, a roughly equal proportion of veterans
live within five miles of a VA clinic. This pattern holds for the proportion
of veterans living within ten miles of a VA clinic. 

That said, a small difference is observable between veterans under 65 and
veterans 65 and over. The younger cohorts tend to disproportionally live 
within five miles of a VA clinic (between 31-35 percent of each cohort) 
compared to veterans over 65 and over (28 percent of the cohort). This
suggests that the VA clinics are potentially more geographically accessible
to younger veterans. That said, this difference is small in magnitude.
